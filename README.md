Tunehacker is a game which requires you to be in sync with all the music around you.

You are an AI that hacks music to make it better for the world.
(makes sense why people haven't died 'cause of hearing JB's songs)
And that way, you course through songs, making yourself in sync.
Any problems, you encounter, will make you out of sync.
Hope you like it when it is finished!

We are probably updating this as you are reading, so feel free to fork and pull!
PS: This is our first android app/project, so feel free to give advice!

Thanks,
